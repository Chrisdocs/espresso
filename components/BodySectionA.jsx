            In my Personal life... The outdoors call me, and I try to spend as
            much time there as I can. Whether it's a walk through our local park
            or a multi-day backpacking trip, I'm game. Then there is the more
            obvious passion - technology. I love seeing how technology can
            change the world, and hopefully in ways which benefit the people who
            use them.
